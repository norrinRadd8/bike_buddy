### User Story

```
AS a concerned parent,
I WANT to easily plot the safest and most efficient cycling routes for my children,
SO THAT I can have peace of mind while they are cycling on the road
```

<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top">back to top</a></p>

### Description

Bike Buddy is the ultimate tool for parents and guardians looking to keep their children safe while cycling. With its interactive map, families can easily search for a location and plot a safe route. This takes into account various factors such as live traffic levels, available bicycle lanes, and lowest elevation to ensure the most efficient and safest route possible for children on the roads.

But Bike Buddy doesn't stop there - it also provides real-time updates on air quality and weather conditions, so users can stay informed and prepared for their ride. Users have the ability to view their current location and with Bike Buddy, families can confidently enjoy biking together on the safest roads available.

### APIs

Bike Buddy is powered by four APIs - TomTom Routing, TomTom Reverse Geocoding, OpenWeatherMap, and AQI (Air Quality Index) - to deliver top-notch information and optimised routes to its users. In addition to these APIs, Bike Buddy also utilises the Leaflet.js library and the Jawg Maps Tile API to provide an interactive and visually appealing map experience. These technologies ensure cycling safety and convenience.

### Design

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### Future Development

Bike Buddy is always looking for ways to improve and enhance the cycling experience for families. We have some exciting ideas that will take Bike Buddy to the next level. With the ability to download routes as a file and see the duration and distance of a chosen route, users can easily track and plan their rides. And with Strava's API integration, users would be able to see their performance statistics and track their progress within Bike Buddy.

Furthermore, a feature where routes are based on the user's past rides and performance on Strava, challenging them to improve their cycling skills and try new routes. Plus, a leaderboard which would allow users to compare their stats with their friends or other Bike Buddy users, adding a fun element of competition. And for added peace of mind, a Bike Buddy safety rating for each generated route.
